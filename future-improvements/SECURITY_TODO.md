# Security & Code Quality TODOs

A checklist of specific files and flows to improve for security and maintainability.

## 1. Authentication & Session Management
- [âœ…] Move JWT and user role storage from sessionStorage to HTTP-only cookies (`useAuth.js`, `isAuthenticated.js`, `gql/client.js`, and all sessionStorage usage)
- [ ] Centralize authentication logic to avoid duplication
- [ ] Add token expiration checks and auto-logout

## 2. Route Protection
- [ ] Ensure all sensitive routes are protected in both frontend and backend (`ProtectedRoute.jsx`, `routes.jsx`)
- [ ] Add user feedback/loading state for unauthorized access

## 3. API Calls & Token Usage
- [ ] Refactor API calls to use a single utility for attaching tokens (`useBookings.js`, `useUsers.js`, `useRooms.js`, `RoomDetails.jsx`, `gql/client.js`)
- [ ] Handle token refresh and error states globally

## 4. Navigation & UI Logic
- [ ] Avoid reading user role directly from sessionStorage in UI components (`Nav.jsx`, `QuickActions.jsx`)
- [ ] Use React context or a global state manager for auth state

## 5. General Security
- [ ] Sanitize and validate all user input (forms, search, etc.)
- [ ] Escape output where user data is rendered

## 6. Dependency Management
- [ ] Regularly audit and update dependencies for vulnerabilities (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
