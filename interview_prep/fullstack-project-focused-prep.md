## 🏨 Your Project: Hotel Booking System

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
*"I built a full-stack hotel booking system using React for the frontend and .NET API for the backend. It includes user authentication, room search and filtering, booking management, and an admin dashboard. The frontend uses modern React patterns with hooks, context for state management, and Material-UI for the interface, while the backend handles secure API endpoints, data validation, and business logic."*

### Technical Stack You Can Discuss

**Frontend:**
- React 19 with modern hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- Material-UI for component library
- Apollo Client for GraphQL (shows API integration skills)
- React Router for navigation
- Framer Motion for animations
- Vite for build tooling

**Backend (.NET - what they'll expect):**
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core
- JWT Authentication
- RESTful API design
- Database integration

## 🎯 Key Interview Talking Points

### 1. Architecture & Project Structure
**Question: "Walk me through your project architecture"**

**Your Answer:**
```
"I structured the React app using atomic design principles:
- Atoms: Basic UI components (buttons, inputs)
- Molecules: Combined components (forms, cards)  
- Organisms: Complex sections (headers, booking forms)
- Templates: Page layouts

For state management, I used Context API for global state like authentication,
and local state with hooks for component-specific data. The backend follows
a clean architecture with controllers, services, and repositories."
```

### 2. Authentication Implementation
**Question: "How did you handle user authentication?"**

**Your Answer:**
```
"I implemented JWT-based authentication:
- Frontend: Store tokens securely, add to API headers
- Backend: JWT middleware for protected routes
- Used React Context to manage auth state globally
- Protected routes component to guard authenticated pages
- Refresh token strategy to maintain sessions"
```

### 3. Data Flow & API Integration
**Question: "How does data flow between frontend and backend?"**

**Your Answer:**
```
"I used Apollo Client for GraphQL integration, but I'm also comfortable with REST:
- Custom hooks for data fetching (useBookings, useRooms)
- Centralized error handling with try-catch patterns
- Loading states and user feedback
- Data validation on both frontend and backend
- Optimistic updates for better UX"
```

## 💡 Technical Deep Dives

### React Patterns You Implemented

```javascript
// Custom Hook Pattern (from your codebase)
const useBookings = () => {
  const [bookings, setBookings] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const fetchBookings = useCallback(async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await client.query({
        query: GET_BOOKINGS
      });
      setBookings(response.data.bookings);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching bookings:', error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);
  
  return { bookings, loading, fetchBookings };
};
```

**Why this is impressive:**
- Shows understanding of custom hooks
- Proper error handling
- Loading state management
- useCallback for performance

### Component Architecture

```javascript
// Your App.jsx structure shows good practices
function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>           {/* Error handling */}
      <AuthProvider>          {/* Global state */}
        <RouterProvider />    {/* Navigation */}
      </AuthProvider>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

**Talk about:**
- Error boundaries for graceful failures
- Provider pattern for state management
- Separation of concerns

## 🔧 Common Full-Stack Questions & Your Answers

### "How do you handle form validation?"
```
"I implement validation on both ends:
- Frontend: Real-time validation with React Hook Form or custom hooks
- Backend: Data annotations and model validation in .NET
- Custom validation messages for better UX
- Server-side validation as the source of truth for security"
```

### "How do you optimize performance?"
```
"Frontend optimization:
- React.memo for component memoization
- useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations
- Code splitting with React.lazy
- Material-UI's built-in optimizations

Backend optimization:
- Entity Framework query optimization
- Async/await for non-blocking operations
- Proper database indexing
- Caching frequently accessed data"
```

### "How do you handle errors?"
```
"Multi-layer error handling:
- Frontend: Error boundaries, try-catch in async operations
- User-friendly error messages with toast notifications
- Backend: Global exception middleware
- Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Logging for debugging and monitoring"
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Decisions You Made

### Material-UI Choice
**Why Material-UI?**
- Consistent, professional design system
- Accessibility built-in
- Customizable theming
- Large component library reduces development time
- Good TypeScript support

### Responsive Design
```css
/* You can discuss mobile-first approach */
.booking-form {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .booking-form {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Advanced Topics You Can Discuss

### GraphQL vs REST
```
"I used Apollo Client with GraphQL for this project because:
- Single endpoint for multiple data requirements
- Strong typing with schema
- Efficient data fetching (no over/under-fetching)
- Real-time updates with subscriptions
- Great developer tooling

But I'm also comfortable with REST APIs and understand when each is appropriate."
```

### Database Design
```
"For the booking system, I designed these key entities:
- Users (authentication, profile info)
- Rooms (types, amenities, pricing)
- Bookings (dates, status, guest info)
- Many-to-many relationships for room amenities
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields"
```

### Security Considerations
```
"Security measures I implemented:
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with EF Core
- CORS configuration
- HTTPS enforcement
- Rate limiting for API endpoints"
```
