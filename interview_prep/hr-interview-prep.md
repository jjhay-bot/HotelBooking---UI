I see this as an opportunity to grow my skills while contributing to projects that make a real impact."*

### 3. "What are your strengths?"
**Pick 2-3 strengths with specific examples**

**Sample Answer:**
*"My biggest strength is my ability to learn quickly and adapt. During the bootcamp, I went from knowing basic HTML to building a full-stack application in just a few months. I'm also very detail-oriented - in my capstone project, I spent extra time ensuring the user interface was intuitive and the code was clean and well-organized. Finally, I work well in teams and communicate effectively, which I demonstrated when collaborating on group projects during my training."*

### 4. "What's your biggest weakness?"
**Choose a real weakness but show how you're improving**

**Sample Answer:**
*"I sometimes spend too much time perfecting details when I could move faster with a 'good enough' solution first. For example, in my recent project, I spent hours fine-tuning the UI when I could have focused on getting the core functionality working first. I'm learning to prioritize MVP features and iterate, rather than trying to make everything perfect from the start. I'm getting better at this by setting time limits for myself and focusing on delivering working features first."*

### 5. "Why did you choose to become a developer?"
**Show genuine passion and motivation**

**Sample Answer:**
*"I've always been drawn to problem-solving and creating things that people can use. When I first wrote code and saw my creation come to life in the browser, I was hooked. What really excites me about development is the combination of logical thinking and creativity - you get to solve complex problems while building user-friendly interfaces. The bootcamp confirmed that this is what I want to do long-term. Every challenge I solved made me more excited about the next one."*

### 6. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
**Show ambition but stay realistic**

**Sample Answer:**
*"In 5 years, I see myself as a strong full-stack developer who can take ownership of features from concept to deployment.

I want to continuously learn new technologies and take on increasingly complex challenges while helping my team and company succeed."*

### 7. "Tell me about a challenge you faced and how you overcame it"
**Use STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result**

**Sample Answer:**
*"During my capstone project, I ran into a complex bug where user authentication wasn't working properly across different pages. The situation was frustrating because everything looked correct, but users were getting logged out randomly. I systematically debugged by checking the browser console, reviewing my authentication flow, and testing different scenarios. I discovered the issue was with how I was managing JWT tokens in local storage. I researched best practices, implemented a more secure token management system, and added better error handling. This taught me the importance of thorough testing and following security best practices. The final result was a more robust authentication system."*

### 8. "How do you handle stress and tight deadlines?"
**Show you can work under pressure professionally**

**Sample Answer:**
*"I handle stress by breaking big tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and prioritizing what's most important. During the bootcamp, we had tight project deadlines, so I learned to focus on getting the core functionality working first before adding nice-to-have features. I also communicate early if I think I might miss a deadline - I'd rather ask for help or adjust expectations than deliver something incomplete. I stay organized with to-do lists and take short breaks when I feel overwhelmed to maintain clear thinking."*

### 9. "Why are you leaving your previous job?" / "Why the career change?"
**Keep it positive, focus on growth**

**Sample Answer:**
*"I decided to transition into tech because I wanted a career that combines problem-solving with creativity and has strong growth potential. While I learned valuable skills in my previous role, I realized my passion lies in building digital solutions that can help people and businesses. The bootcamp gave me the foundation I needed, and now I'm excited to apply these skills professionally and continue learning in a dynamic field like software development."*
