# Personal Interview Guide

## About Myself

I'm a Software Engineer with almost 4 years of experience, primarily focused on front-end development using React and Next.js. Recently, I've been expanding into full-stack development, integrating .NET Web API with React through bootcamp training.

**Technical Experience:**
- Front-end development with React and Next.js
- GraphQL implementation and API integration
- AWS S3 for file upload & storage solutions
- Google Apps Script for automation
- Full-stack development with .NET Web API + React
- Building clean, responsive, and scalable interfaces

**Current Focus:**
- Writing reusable components and improving app performance
- Bridging front-end and back-end systems for seamless user experiences
- Expanding backend development skills through hands-on projects

## What Are Your Strengths?

**My biggest strengths are:**

1. **Quick Learning & Adaptability** - I can rapidly pick up new technologies and adapt to different project requirements.

2. **Thorough Preparation** - I spend extra time understanding user stories and project requirements upfront to deliver better results.

3. **Code Quality Focus** - I maintain clean, well-organized code that's easy to maintain and scale.

4. **Team Collaboration** - I communicate effectively and actively seek advice from team members when needed, fostering a collaborative environment.

## What's Your Biggest Weakness?

**I have two main areas I'm actively working to improve:**

1. **Technical Debt Management** - I tend to focus on getting functionality done first and plan to clean up later, but sometimes time constraints make it hard to go back for improvements. I've been working on managing this better by doing small cleanups as I go rather than leaving everything for later.

2. **Backend Confidence** - I wasn't very confident in backend development initially. However, after completing the bootcamp, I've built much more confidence handling backend tasks and security considerations on my own. I'm continuing to strengthen these skills through practical projects.

## Why Did You Become a Developer?

I actually started my career as a civil engineer, where we worked on steel structure calculation tools. While collaborating with developers on these projects, I became really interested in how those applications were built.

Since I've always been good at problem-solving, formulas, and analysis, I decided to shift to tech so I could apply those same analytical skills to building solutions myself. That's how I got into development — and it's been really fulfilling to create tools that make complex tasks simpler for users.

The transition felt natural because both fields require logical thinking, attention to detail, and systematic problem-solving approaches.

## Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?

In five years, I see myself as a more well-rounded full-stack developer who can handle both front-end and backend responsibilities confidently.

**My goals include:**
- Continuously improving my technical skills, especially in system design and architecture
- Eventually taking on a role where I can mentor other developers or lead technical projects
- Growing within a team that values learning and building meaningful products
- Contributing to larger-scale systems and more complex technical challenges

Overall, I want to keep growing both technically and as a team member while working on projects that have real impact.

## How Do You Handle Stress and Tight Deadlines?

When I'm under tight deadlines, I focus on getting the main functionality done first to ensure the product works as expected.

**My approach includes:**
- **Prioritization** - Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable goals
- **Early Communication** - Letting the team know early if timelines might be tight
- **MVP First** - Delivering core functionality first, then iterating with improvements
- **Quality Balance** - Ensuring the project keeps moving without completely sacrificing quality

This approach is similar to how I handle work in general — I prioritize delivery first, then plan incremental improvements when there's time, so the project maintains momentum.

## Why Are You Leaving Your Previous Job?

I've learned a lot in my current role over the past few years, especially in front-end development using React and Next.js. But I've reached a point where I want to take on new challenges.

**My motivations for change:**
- **Growth Opportunity** - I want to grow more as a full-stack developer
- **Technical Challenges** - Looking for projects that push me to improve both technically and collaboratively
- **Team Environment** - Seeking an environment where I can continue learning while contributing to meaningful, high-quality products
- **Career Progression** - Ready to take on more responsibility and expand my skill set
