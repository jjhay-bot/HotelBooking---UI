What are your STRENGTH?"
- My biggest strength is my ability to learn quickly and adapt. 
- spent extra time in advance and familiar with the userstory
- maintain was clean and well-organized. 
- communicate and ask advice to team members when needed.


about MYSELF
- Software Engineer for almost 4 years, mainly works in front-end development using React and Next.js
- Recently expanding into full-stack development, integrating .NET Web API with React
- Experienced with GraphQL, AWS S3 (file upload & storage), and Google Apps Script for simple automations
- Strong focus on building clean, responsive, and scalable interfaces
- Enjoys bridging front-end and back-end systems for seamless user experiences
- Currently focusing on writing reusable components and improving app performance


my WEAKNESS
- I tend to focus on getting functionality done first and plan to clean up later, but sometimes time constraints make it hard to go back for improvements. I’ve been working on managing that better by doing small cleanups as I go.
- I wasn’t very confident on BE development. But after the bootcamp, I’ve built more confidence handling backend tasks and security considerations on my own.


why become a DEVELOPER
- I actually started my career as a civil engineer, where we worked on steel structure calculation tools. While collaborating with developers, I became really interested in how those applications were built.
- Since I’ve always been good at problem-solving, formulas, and analysis, I decided to shift to tech so I could apply those same skills in building solutions myself. That’s how I got into development — and it’s been really fulfilling to create tools that make complex tasks simpler.


after 5YEARS
- In five years, I see myself as a more well-rounded full-stack developer who can handle both front-end and backend responsibilities confidently. I want to keep improving my technical skills, especially in system design and architecture, and eventually take on a role where I can mentor others or lead projects. Overall, I want to keep growing in a team that values learning and building meaningful products.


handle STRESS and DEADLINES
- When I’m under tight deadlines, I focus on getting the main functionality done first to make sure the product works as expected. I’ve learned to manage stress by breaking tasks into smaller goals and communicating early if timelines might be tight. It’s similar to how I handle my work in general 
- I prioritize delivery first, then plan small cleanups when there’s time, so the project keeps moving without losing quality.


why LEAVING previews job 
- I’ve learned a lot in my current role over the past few years, especially in front-end development using React and Next.js. But I’ve reached a point where I want to take on new challenges — particularly to grow more as a full-stack developer and work on projects that push me to improve both technically and collaboratively. I’m looking for an environment where I can continue learning while contributing to meaningful, high-quality products.


any QUESTION for us?
- Can you share more about the current tech stack and how the front-end and backend teams collaborate?
- How does the team define success for this role?
