## 🔧 Technical Questions - .NET/C#

### Core C# Concepts
- **What's the difference between value types and reference types?**
  - Value types (int, bool, struct) stored on stack
  - Reference types (class, interface, delegate) stored on heap
  
- **Explain async/await and when to use it**
  - Asynchronous programming for I/O operations
  - Prevents blocking the main thread
  - Example: API calls, database operations, file I/O

- **What are the different access modifiers in C#?**
  - `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `protected internal`

- **Explain dependency injection in .NET**
  - Design pattern for loosely coupled code
  - Built-in DI container in .NET Core
  - Scoped, Transient, Singleton lifetimes

### ASP.NET Core Web API
- **What's the difference between MVC and Web API?**
  - MVC returns views, Web API returns data (JSON/XML)
  - Web API optimized for HTTP services

- **Explain the request pipeline in ASP.NET Core**
  - Middleware components process HTTP requests
  - Order matters in Configure() method

- **What are action filters and when would you use them?**
  - Cross-cutting concerns (logging, authentication, validation)
  - `[Authorize]`, `[ValidateModel]`, custom filters

- **How do you handle errors in Web API?**
  - Global exception handling middleware
  - Try-catch blocks for specific scenarios
  - Custom error responses

### Common Coding Questions
```csharp
// Be ready to explain LINQ operations
var result = users.Where(u => u.IsActive)
                 .OrderBy(u => u.Name)
                 .Select(u => new { u.Id, u.Name });

// Explain Entity Framework relationships
public class User 
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List<Order> Orders { get; set; } // One-to-many
}
```

## ⚛️ Technical Questions - React/Frontend

### React Fundamentals
- **What's the difference between functional and class components?**
  - Functional: simpler, use hooks for state/lifecycle
  - Class: older approach, more verbose

- **Explain React hooks you've used**
  - `useState`: manage component state
  - `useEffect`: side effects, lifecycle replacement
  - `useContext`: consume context without nesting
  - Custom hooks for reusable logic

- **What's the virtual DOM and why is it useful?**
  - In-memory representation of real DOM
  - Efficient diffing and reconciliation
  - Better performance for frequent updates

- **How do you handle state management?**
  - Local state with useState
  - Context API for global state
  - Libraries like Redux, Zustand for complex apps

### React Best Practices
- **How do you optimize React performance?**
  - `React.memo()` for component memoization
  - `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` hooks
  - Code splitting with lazy loading
  - Avoid inline functions in JSX

- **What's prop drilling and how do you solve it?**
  - Passing props through multiple levels
  - Solutions: Context API, state management libraries

### JavaScript/ES6+
- **Explain promises and async/await**
- **What's the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?**
- **Explain array methods: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`**
- **What are template literals and destructuring?**

## 🔗 Full-Stack Integration

### API Communication
- **How do you make API calls from React?**
```javascript
// Using fetch or axios
const fetchUsers = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/users');
    const data = await response.json();
    setUsers(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
};
```

- **How do you handle authentication between frontend and backend?**
  - JWT tokens in headers
  - HTTP-only cookies for security
  - Refresh token strategy

- **What's CORS and how do you handle it?**
  - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
  - Configure in .NET API startup/program.cs
  - Security consideration for production

### Data Flow
- **How do you structure API responses?**
```csharp
public class ApiResponse<T>
{
    public bool Success { get; set; }
    public string Message { get; set; }
    public T Data { get; set; }
}
```

## 🏗️ System Design & Architecture

### Architecture Patterns
- **Explain MVC pattern in .NET**
  - Model: data and business logic
  - View: user interface
  - Controller: handles user input, coordinates model and view

- **What's Repository pattern and why use it?**
  - Abstraction layer over data access
  - Easier testing and maintenance
  - Separation of concerns

- **How would you design a simple e-commerce API?**
  - Users, Products, Orders, OrderItems entities
  - Authentication/Authorization
  - Product catalog management
  - Order processing workflow

### Scalability Considerations
- **How do you handle large amounts of data?**
  - Pagination in API responses
  - Lazy loading in React
  - Database indexing
  - Caching strategies

---

## 🗄️ Database & Data Management

### Entity Framework Core
- **What's Code First vs Database First?**
  - Code First: define models in C#, generate database
  - Database First: existing database, generate models

- **Explain migrations in EF Core**
  - Version control for database schema
  - `Add-Migration`, `Update-Database` commands

- **How do you optimize database queries?**
  - Use `.Include()` for related data
  - Avoid N+1 query problem
  - Use projections with `.Select()`

### SQL Basics
Be ready to write basic SQL queries:
```sql
-- Join tables
SELECT u.Name, o.OrderDate
FROM Users u
INNER JOIN Orders o ON u.Id = o.UserId
WHERE u.IsActive = 1;
```
